Academically, I am a second-year student at Georgia Tech. My favorite
courses have been Data Structures & Algorithms, Introduction to
Artificial Intelligence, and Design & Analysis of Algorithms. These
courses have challenged me to think creatively and have taught me
how to solve complex problems in new ways.
Additionally, I have been working with the DART lab for the past two
semesters as part of the Low-Cost Aerial VIP, where we are exploring
the application of machine learning to aircraft flight planning. My focus
has been on using imitation learning to improve model training time, and
we are also working on a publication examining the effectiveness of
using tree search algorithms to enhance agent dogfighting ability.
As a Teaching Assistant for Introduction to OOP in the spring of 2021, I
improved communication skills by presenting weekly recitations, holding
office hours, and grading student work. This role strengthened my
understanding of OOP and taught me how to explain computer science
concepts clearly to students with different learning styles.
This summer, I will be working as a Data Engineer at Gordon Food
Service, where I will learn about the fundamentals of data pipelines,
which are essential to machine learning. In this role, I am excited to
apply academic knowledge in a practical setting.
In my first year at Georgia Tech, I was part of the Global Leadership
Living Learning Community, which focused on exploring the 17 United
Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their potential
impact on our future careers. As a computer scientist, I believe that
machine learning can be used to advance the SDGs, particularly in
areas such as waste reduction and optimal decision-making.
Overall, my academic background, research experience, and teaching
experience have provided me with a strong foundation in computer
science and machine learning. I believe these experiences are a strong
foundation that will lead to success in my masters studies and beyond.
