Machine learning is a field that has captured my imagination since I first
heard about it. As a human, I believe that our ability to solve novel
problems without instruction is what sets us apart. The idea that
machines could be developed to perform such complex problem-solving
tasks is truly remarkable. Equipped with the precision of computers,
these machines have the potential to revolutionize the world by solving
problems that have not even been identified yet. I am excited to be part
of this growth in machine learning and believe that pursuing a master's
degree is the best way to deepen my understanding of this technology.
My ultimate goal is to apply my skills and knowledge to advance
sustainability efforts.
During my undergraduate studies at Georgia Tech, I have actively
sought opportunities to explore machine learning. Joining the Low-Cost
Aerial Autonomy VIP provided me with an excellent opportunity to learn
about machine learning's impact on flight planning and adversarial
flight. Working on this project was a deep dive into machine learning
fundamentals, including implementing neural networks, feature
extraction, and reward functions. In the second semester of the VIP
program, I have been working on a research paper on applying learned
motion primitives to adversarial situations, which has further confirmed
my passion for machine learning.
I am also currently enrolled in Thad Starner's Introduction to Artificial
Intelligence course. The class, offered jointly with the master's section,
has been more challenging than typical undergraduate courses. The
assignments, such as tri-directional A* search and iterative deepening
alpha-beta pruning, have been demanding, but also incredibly
rewarding. This experience has convinced me that I want to explore
machine learning in greater depth during my master's studies.
When I first came to Georgia Tech from Cincinnati, I was uncertain
about what to expect. It was a risky move that would increase tuition
costs for my family, but I knew that Georgia Tech was a special place
and decided to take the risk. In the year and a half that I have been
here, I have come to appreciate the balance of hard work, creativity,
and fun that is characteristic of the Georgia Tech lifestyle. The college
of computing is home to truly exceptional faculty members who are at
the top of their fields. For these reasons, I would be thrilled to continue
my education at Georgia Tech and pursue a master's degree.
Ultimately, I want to become a Machine Learning Engineer with a
particular interest in sustainability. In my view, the most pressing
challenge facing humanity is how to live sustainably so that the earth
can continue to support us. Machine learning has already been applied
in sectors such as agriculture and sustainability to optimize energy and
material use and limit waste. I want to build on this work and apply
machine learning to a broader range of sectors. I believe that by using
machine learning to support sustainability, I can positively influence the
world.
In conclusion, I am eager to pursue a master's degree in machine
learning at Georgia Tech to deepen my understanding of this exciting
field. I am confident that this program will equip me with the knowledge
and experience I need to achieve my career goals effectively.
