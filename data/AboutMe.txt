Grand Canyon Essay
At only eight years old, I faced a challenge that provided an instrumental lesson for my life.  My family and I hiked rim to rim across the Grand Canyon over summer vacation, a hike that less than one percent of park visitors attempt.  The 25 mile trail featured 6000 feet of elevation change, scorching temperatures of over 120 degrees, jagged cliffs, rattlesnakes, and water sources that were far in between.  It was an ambitious trek for any hiker -- let alone a young beginner like myself.  
Quickly into the journey the trail took its toll on me.  My feet blistered and ached.  My calves developed intense sunburns.  My arms became exhausted from hauling my pack that was filled with my clothing and other supplies.  A layer of dust caked my entire body.  I reached the campground at the base of the canyon fatigued.  More concerning, the following day we were set to climb against gravity, up and out of the canyon.  I remember arguing with my parents, asking to stay at our campground just one more day to rest.  I even briefly considered asking my dad to carry me the rest of the way.  The impending task had made me anxious and uncomfortable and I wanted an escape -- there was none.
I awoke on the third day determined to finish the work.  I grinded through the final miles of the journey, pushing myself past points I knew I had.  Oddly, the ache in my feet and the pain in my arms subsided, as I became lost in focus.  Eventually, I crested the canyon, arriving at the South Rim gift shop.  I looked around in disbelief, as tourists posed for pictures in front of the nearby overlook.  Most of the adults were wearing sandals, Cokes in hand.  Few of them even ventured to the trailhead, satisfied with the view from the overlook.  Seeing the adults gave me a sense of pride: at eight years old I had accomplished something many very few of the adults present had even tried.  From that moment, I learned that hard work was worth it.  The pain I had felt just hours earlier did no longer seem so bad.  I learned that when I am uncomfortable -- feeling overwhelmed by tasks ahead and questioning if I am capable -- to go for it because at these moments I have the opportunity to do something remarkable.  It taught me that I am often more capable than I believe.  I should not limit myself by trying to escape the problems that lie ahead of me. 
Although I may not think of the rim to rim hike with every challenge that I face, the character I gained while on the trail has stuck with me.  I use the same grit I had to call upon on the trail regularly, whether during late nights of studying, long practices, or hard tests.  The canyon taught me not to fear trying new things.  Just as I was a beginner hiker in the canyon, there have been and will be many times in my life where I am a beginner.  Having confidence in my capability, even in times of difficulty, will be essential to my ability to learn new skills in my future.  Finally, the canyon taught me how procrastination is a poor way to handle obstacles.  In the bottom of the canyon, I wanted to avoid the struggle of the hike, so I tried to delay the climb another day.  This procrastination would not have helped my situation, as eventually I would have to face the challenge.  Knowing this, in my life I have always tried to attack my challenges directly, instead allowing them to linger.  The character instilled in me by the Grand Canyon will continue to serve me throughout my life.

Machine Learning Essay
Machine learning is a field that has captured my imagination since I first
heard about it. As a human, I believe that our ability to solve novel
problems without instruction is what sets us apart. The idea that
machines could be developed to perform such complex problem-solving
tasks is truly remarkable. Equipped with the precision of computers,
these machines have the potential to revolutionize the world by solving
problems that have not even been identified yet. I am excited to be part
of this growth in machine learning and believe that pursuing a master's
degree is the best way to deepen my understanding of this technology.
My ultimate goal is to apply my skills and knowledge to advance
sustainability efforts.
During my undergraduate studies at Georgia Tech, I have actively
sought opportunities to explore machine learning. Joining the Low-Cost
Aerial Autonomy VIP provided me with an excellent opportunity to learn
about machine learning's impact on flight planning and adversarial
flight. Working on this project was a deep dive into machine learning
fundamentals, including implementing neural networks, feature
extraction, and reward functions. In the second semester of the VIP
program, I have been working on a research paper on applying learned
motion primitives to adversarial situations, which has further confirmed
my passion for machine learning.
I am also currently enrolled in Thad Starner's Introduction to Artificial
Intelligence course. The class, offered jointly with the master's section,
has been more challenging than typical undergraduate courses. The
assignments, such as tri-directional A* search and iterative deepening
alpha-beta pruning, have been demanding, but also incredibly
rewarding. This experience has convinced me that I want to explore
machine learning in greater depth during my master's studies.
When I first came to Georgia Tech from Cincinnati, I was uncertain
about what to expect. It was a risky move that would increase tuition
costs for my family, but I knew that Georgia Tech was a special place
and decided to take the risk. In the year and a half that I have been
here, I have come to appreciate the balance of hard work, creativity,
and fun that is characteristic of the Georgia Tech lifestyle. The college
of computing is home to truly exceptional faculty members who are at
the top of their fields. For these reasons, I would be thrilled to continue
my education at Georgia Tech and pursue a master's degree.
Ultimately, I want to become a Machine Learning Engineer with a
particular interest in sustainability. In my view, the most pressing
challenge facing humanity is how to live sustainably so that the earth
can continue to support us. Machine learning has already been applied
in sectors such as agriculture and sustainability to optimize energy and
material use and limit waste. I want to build on this work and apply
machine learning to a broader range of sectors. I believe that by using
machine learning to support sustainability, I can positively influence the
world.
In conclusion, I am eager to pursue a master's degree in machine
learning at Georgia Tech to deepen my understanding of this exciting
field. I am confident that this program will equip me with the knowledge
and experience I need to achieve my career goals effectively.

Academic Background:
Academically, I am a second-year student at Georgia Tech. My favorite
courses have been Data Structures & Algorithms, Introduction to
Artificial Intelligence, and Design & Analysis of Algorithms. These
courses have challenged me to think creatively and have taught me
how to solve complex problems in new ways.
Additionally, I have been working with the DART lab for the past two
semesters as part of the Low-Cost Aerial VIP, where we are exploring
the application of machine learning to aircraft flight planning. My focus
has been on using imitation learning to improve model training time, and
we are also working on a publication examining the effectiveness of
using tree search algorithms to enhance agent dogfighting ability.
As a Teaching Assistant for Introduction to OOP in the spring of 2021, I
improved communication skills by presenting weekly recitations, holding
office hours, and grading student work. This role strengthened my
understanding of OOP and taught me how to explain computer science
concepts clearly to students with different learning styles.
This summer, I will be working as a Data Engineer at Gordon Food
Service, where I will learn about the fundamentals of data pipelines,
which are essential to machine learning. In this role, I am excited to
apply academic knowledge in a practical setting.
In my first year at Georgia Tech, I was part of the Global Leadership
Living Learning Community, which focused on exploring the 17 United
Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their potential
impact on our future careers. As a computer scientist, I believe that
machine learning can be used to advance the SDGs, particularly in
areas such as waste reduction and optimal decision-making.
Overall, my academic background, research experience, and teaching
experience have provided me with a strong foundation in computer
science and machine learning. I believe these experiences are a strong
foundation that will lead to success in my masters studies and beyond.
