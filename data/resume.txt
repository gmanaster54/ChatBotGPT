• Machine Learning • Artificial Intelligence • Data Structures • Algorithms Analysis
Experience
Gordon Food Service May 2023 – July 2023
Data Engineering Intern Atlanta, Georgia
• Developed an event driven pipeline to transfer customer feedback data to Gordon’s data lake, enabling 100x increase
feedback collection, $20,000 in developer time saved per year, and new insights on driver quality of service.
• Developed an asynchronous pipeline to transfer finance payloads from a third party API to the data lake, enabling the
finance data to improve analyst insights.
• Utilized GCP, Python, Terraform, and Jenkins in order to define functionality, provision, and deploy data pipelines as
well as generative AI in order to generate mock data for quality assurance testing.
• Member of Data Engineering Agile Team, completed 20+ Jira tickets, participated in PR review, daily stand up, sprint
retrospective and PI planning.
GT College of Computing Jan 2022 – May 2022
Teaching Assistant, Introduction to Object Oriented Programming Atlanta, Georgia
• Designed JUnit testing to automate homework grading, saving TA and instructor time.
• Presented weekly recitations to 40+ students and held help desk office hours
• Authored homework assignments, practice problems and exam questions to test Object Oriented principles.
Research
Dynamic Adaptive Robotic Technologies (DART) Lab Aug 2022 – Present
Research Assistant, Low Cost Aerial Artificial Intelligence Team
• Apply machine learning to adversarial flight planning, utilizing machine learning libraries of PyTorch, Gym and
Stable-Baselines3 to train agents in simulate aerial dog fighting.
• Improved agent win rate by implementing autonomous Optuna hyper parameter tuning to optimize exploration and
exploitation constants.
• Leveraging Machine Learning for Generating and Utilizing Motion Primitives in Adversarial Environments: Co-authored
paper in review for the Journal of Aerospace Information Systems, with focus on applying beam search to MCTS in order
to select quality motion primitives under strict time constraints.
Projects
VR Graphing Calculator, GTXR Club | Unity, C#, Oculus Fall 2022
